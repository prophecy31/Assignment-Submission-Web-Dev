<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>As a video game enthusiast and someone who not only grew up playing these games but also competed as a semi-pro esports athlete, 
  it was natural for me to wonder if maybe I could not just play the games but maybe create them.</p>

<p>I have created various game assets and environments and bring my experience as a 3D artist, Video Editor, and avid gamer with me. 
  The combination of these skills fits well with what may be required of me. I have created short 3D Animation for film intros and 
  edited Youtube gaming videos, part-time for a month, this gives me an insight into the market and the expectations of the audience.</p>
