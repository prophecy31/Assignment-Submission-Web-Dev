<p>Ernest Miller Hemingway was an American novelist, short-story writer, and journalist. His economical and understated
style—which included his iceberg theory—had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his adventurous lifestyle 
and public image brought him admiration from later generations. Hemingway produced most of his work between the mid-1920s 
and the mid-1950s, and he was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Literature. He published seven novels, six short-story collections, 
and two nonfiction works. Three of his novels, four short-story collections, and three nonfiction works were published posthumously. 
Many of his works are considered classics of American literature.</p>

<p>In 1921, he married Hadley Richardson, the first of four wives. They moved to Paris, where he worked as a foreign correspondent 
for the Toronto Star and fell under the influence of the modernist writers and artists of the 1920s' "Lost Generation" expatriate 
community. Hemingway's debut novel The Sun Also Rises was published in 1926. He divorced Richardson in 1927, and married Pauline Pfeiffer. 
They divorced after he returned from the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), which he covered as a journalist and which was the basis for his 
novel For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940). Martha Gellhorn became his third wife in 1940. He and Gellhorn separated after he met Mary Welsh in 
London during World War II. Hemingway was present with Allied troops as a journalist at the Normandy landings and the liberation of Paris.</p>
